            powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15

        Editor's note
    </h3>
    <p>
        Canned beans and tomato sauce contain varying amounts of salt, and the dish will taste more salty
        as it continues to simmer. Tasting and adding salt to the chili after it is finished will allow
        you to add just the right amount.
